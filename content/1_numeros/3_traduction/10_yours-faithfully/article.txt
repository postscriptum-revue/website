Subtitle: Die Leiden des jungen Werthers for the English-language Stage

Abstract-fr: <p>Il existe plusieurs traductions anglaises du roman épistolaire de Goethe, Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (1774). Toutefois, ce roman psychologique portant sur le thème du suicide noble est peu « théâtral » ou, du moins, peu propice à l’adaptation pour la scène. Ainsi, de toutes les adaptations théâtrales anglaises existantes, aucune n’est décrite comme « fidèle ». Cet article propose une analyse des obstacles à l’adaptation (une forme de traduction en soi). En se basant tant sur le modèle tripartite de la traduction de Goethe que sur « les trois modes d’adaptation » du théoricien en études cinématographiques Geoffrey Wagner, l’auteur a tenté de réaliser une transposition (traduction/adaptation) prosaïque et sans ajout. L’auteur cerne d’abord chacun des obstacles à une traduction/adaptation fidèle, puis aborde chaque problème individuellement Selon son hypothèse de départ, il est possible de créer une pièce de théâtre sémantiquement très proche de l’original, c’est-à-dire dont le résultat est fidèle au roman, si ces obstacles sont abordés de façon systématique.</p>

Abstract-en: <p>Although numerous different English translations of Goethe’s 1774 ‘nobility in suicide’-themed, epistolary, psychological and therefore “untheatrical” novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers have been published, no English-language stage adaptation has ever been described as “faithful”. With reference to Goethe’s three-tiered model of translation and cinema theorist Geoffrey Wagner’s “Three modes of adaptation” the author has attempted to write a prosaic, transpositional and unaugmented translation/adaptation for the English-language stage. Each of the obstacles to faithful translation/adaptation were addressed, the hypothesis being that if the obstacles were systematically overcome, then an English-language stageplay closely corresponding in meaning to the principal themes of the novel —that is, a work arguably faithful to the novel— could be created.</p>

However, in assessing the faithfulness of any translation surely the first concern is the title. Without an epithet that indicates immediately the work of the original author the translator’s fidelity is likely to be instantly questioned by the reader. Malthus’s title <em>The Sorrows of Werter : a German Story,</em> therefore raises concerns. Apart from parochially implying that it is a uniquely German story, the protagonist’s name is changed. Although “Werther” is a common German name it would not be familiar to English-speaking audiences. Nor would the variants other translators have used such as “Verter” or “Werter”, which were probably chosen to impress upon the English reader the correct pronunciation (however, in my opinion, “Vairter” would have achieved this objective more effectively). The problem of this Teutonic moniker is further exacerbated by the lack of any contemporary English name that is phonetically similar. The name “Werther”, not co-incidentally, means “the worthy one” in German (coming from “Werte” meaning “worth” (Dahl 263)) but there exists no English Christian name with similar aetiology. Therefore, to deviate from the name “Werther” in translating the title of this novel as Malthus and others have done is unjustifiable if their aim was indeed a faithful translation. “Leiden” is also difficult to translate and has meant “sorrows” or “suffering” to various translators. Not all dictionaries include the word “sorrow” in their definition of “Leiden” and the <em>Random House German</em>–<em>English, English</em>–<em>German Dictionary</em> defines “Leiden” as “suffering, disease” (1989 : 142). I suspect the use of the word “sorrows” has not been interrogated since Malthus. Regardless of any polemic against the various palimpsests of Goethe’s novel, ultimately no authoritative translation of the title <em>Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</em> exists. Hence I decided to use the following sobriquet because it uses the correct spelling of the name “Werther” ; it combines the two most common translations of the word “Leiden” ; “sorrows” and “sufferings” (the alliteration is fortunate, being an appropriate “idiom’ for the reader of today) and because it indicates it is to be a stageplay and not a novel. Thus, the title of my work is <em>The Sorrows and Sufferings of Young Werther ; a Stageplay.</em></p><p>As indicated by the above discourse on the title alone, the challenge of translating perfectly and indisputably a foreign work such as <em>Werther</em> into English is insurmountable. A “word for word” translation will inevitably lose the subtle yet important literary devices of rhythm, metre, form, rhyme, alliteration, pun, onomatopoeia, colloquialism, etc. Hulse said in a Melbourne interview : “there’s nothing in the book that could point the way forward to a poet writing today” (Australian Broadcasting Commission). Thus, this author, perhaps like others before him, felt free to attempt another translation. To do so with confidence, however, was onerous, due to the distracting variety in translations by others [For example, the very first colloquy in the novel is between Werther and a young servant girl fetching water at the fountain. The German is : “ ‘Soll ich Ihr helfen, Jungfer ?’ sagte ich. —sie ward rot ueber und ueber— ‘O nein, Herr !’ sagte sie —‘Ohne Umstaende’— ” (Goethe 8). This has been variously translated as :</p><p>1) “ ‘Shall I help you, my dear ?’ I said. ‘Oh ! No ! Sir !’, she answered, colouring. ‘Make no ceremony,’ said I…” (Malthus 9).<br>2) “ ‘Shall I help you, pretty lass’ said I. She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, sir !’ she exclaimed. ‘No ceremony !’ I replied” (Carlyle and Boylan 2001, un-numbered web page).<br>3) “ ‘May I assist the young maid ?’ said I. —She blushed from top to toe.— ‘Oh no, sir !’ said she. —‘No standing on ceremony,’ said I” (Hulse 28-29).<br>4) “ ‘Shall I help you, Miss ?’ I said —Her face turned a deep red.— ‘Oh no, sir,’ she said. —‘It’s a trifle.’ ” (Steinhauer 4), and,<br>5) “ ‘Shall I help you ?’ I said. She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, no, sir.’ She exclaimed. ‘Come now ! No ceremony !’ I replied” (Lange 8).</p><p>Apparently, even the least poetic of Goethe’s words can be interpreted differently. Goethe’s word “Jungfer” has been translated as “my dear” by Malthus, “pretty lass” by Carlyle and Boylan, “young maid” by Hulse and “Miss” by Steinhauer, yet the term is avoided entirely by Lange ! Indeed, Lange’s caution is understandable when one reads the <em>Random</em> <em>House</em> definition of ‘jungfer’ ; “Maid, spinster, virgin.” (Dahl 121). Malthus interpreted the word “ Jungfer” as a greeting of affection, Carlyle and Boylan saw its meaning of “prettiness”, Hulse stressed his reading of “youth” and Steinhauser understood it to be “marital status” while neither of them, Lange not withstanding, share my reading of “sexual purity or virginity”, as influenced by the <em>Random</em> <em>House</em> elucidation. It is not unlikely that the Werther values chastity and in the idyllic, unspoiled surroundings of the fountain would recoil from a sight incongruous with that environment. Rather, he rushes to help this “Jungfer”, who blushes like a virgin at his efforts. However, it would also be unlikely that Werther would be so gauche as to cry “Shall I help you, virgin ?” Thus my translated reading of “pure lady” is arrived at by consideration of the previous attempts at translation, the <em>Random</em> <em>House</em> dictionary’s definition, and my own preference, and I translated the above passage as follows :</p><p>6) “ ‘May I assist you, pure lady ?’ I said. — She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, no, Sir !’ She exclaimed. ‘Come, come ! Let’s not make a ceremony of it !’ I replied.”</p><p>Whilst there are many variations in translation of even this short passage, it must be readily conceded neither Malthus, Carlyle and Boylan, Hulse, Dahl, Lange, Steinhauer nor I have the definitive translation !].

When Malthus called his translation <em>The Sorrows of Werter</em> he was apparently declaring the adjective “jungen” either irrelevant, unnecessary or inadvisable. Such an excision arguably takes the new work into a realm other than faithful translation as the new author has made a judgement on the original’s value, changed the meaning and therefore created augmented and unfaithful authorship.

A solution to the epistolary form of the novel was the decision to frame the story with an introductory scene showing Wilhelm, Werther’s epistolary confidante, collecting his letters together and bemoaning “Warum haben wir Deutschen eigentlich keine Nationalliteratur ? Die Engländer haben eine, Franzosen, die Italieener… ?” [[I translated this as “Why have we Germans no national literature ? The English have one, the French, the Italian…”]]. From the start Wilhelm establishes the need to publish the letters as an epistolary novel and thus confirm what is now regarded as a classic of German literature. He continues : “Aber wehe, ihr lässt die Leute nicht auch weinen. Die haben Werther so schnell verscharrt nach seinem Tode… Warum hat er sich erschossen ?” [[I translated this as “The people have to cry over his death but he was far too quickly buried… Why did he kill himself ?”]]. Thus the audience is told from the very beginning that Werther’s story is epistolary, that Werther has killed himself, and that while regrettable it is not an act deserving of over hasty burial and forgetting, i.e. it was noble. Then the action of the film begins with the depiction of the events written about in the early letters of Werther. Of course, the theme of glorious suicide is only gradually developed in the novel —unless one interprets the opening line, “Wie froh bin ich, dass ich weg bin !” [[I translated this as “How happy I am, that I am gone !”]], to be the voice of the already dead Werther. Then, at the end of the movie, like a bookend, there is a flash forward, after Werther’s suicide, to Wilhelm’s present and, inventively, the viewer is shown another overly emotional Werther-like figure —a “spinner” [[I translated this as “crack-pot”.]]— tending preciously to a pot-plant in his workplace, like Werther, unbending to the exigencies of the pedantic offices of the ruling classes. Again this is an example of augmented authorship by the screenwriters, but the film nevertheless remains faithful to the principal thematic ideology of <em>Werther.</em></p><p>Examining case studies of other foreign language epistolary novels that have been successfully and faithfully translated/adapted into English stageplays or films is useful. One such comparable work is <em>The Diary of a Young Girl</em> by Anne Frank in 1947 [[Translated into English by B. M. Mooyaart and reprinted in 1995. First published posthumously and edited by Anne Frank’s father, then translated from the Dutch in 1952.]]<em>.</em> The book is a collection of diary entries by a young Jewish girl during the Holocaust of WWII. It was later adapted into a Tony award winning stageplay in 1956 titled <em>The diary of Anne Frank</em> [[Produced by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.]]. Then in 1959 it was adapted into a screenplay and produced as a movie of the same name [[Produced and directed by George Stevens.]]. This case of adaptation from firstly, a foreign language novel to English novel ; secondly from epistolary form to stageplay and thirdly ; from stageplay to screenplay, represents an appropriate point of comparison for this exercise in <em>Werther</em>’<em>s</em> translation/adaptation. The productions show Anne actually writing at times but both the stageplay and the screenplay solve the quandary of converting the entries in a diary into a diapason of flowing narrative by, like Gunther’s film, depicting visually most of the events the diarist writes of. The creators of both the stageplay and the screenplay chose not to depict these events, however, from the diarist’s first point of view —through Anne Frank’s eyes, so to speak— but rather as if from the perspective of an omnipresent, invisible third party. Another very important theatrical and cinematic device used in both the stageplay and the screenplay is the “flashback” —a return to an earlier time. Anne’s father returns to the factory after the war and discovers the diary. He picks it up and starts reading. In the theatre the lights go down and a scene change to that of the wartime attic occurs. It is conventional in movies for a flashback to often be accompanied by an optical effect such as loss of focus, wave-like distortion or a swirling rotation of the picture. Audiences have been conditioned to understand that this cinematic device indicates the momentary psychology of the narrator. The third device used to overcome the challenges of adapting an epistolary document to a visual medium is the voice-over, which both this stageplay and screenplay employ. It has become a very popular device in cinema, and is often used to express the character’s unspoken thoughts whereas an onstage soliloquy would have been the only device fulfilling this purpose in older theatre productions. In the example of the movie of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank,</em> the voice-over is of the diarist reading aloud her written entries. In the stageplay, Anne’s father’s initial reading of the diary out loud is overlapped by the actress reading the same entry concurrent to the flashback/scene change. In the movie the voice-over of Anne also has a slight echo to it, further emphasising the flashback nature and also suggesting the ultimate fate of Anne. The final words of the movie are a repeat of an earlier voice-over ; “In spite of everything I still believe that people are good at heart”, sounding more than a little like a voice echoing from the grave.</p><p>Hence, solutions to the problem of the epistolary nature of <em>Werther,</em> as suggested by the Gunther film and the Anne Frank productions, include an opening scene showing a projection onto a rear cyclorama of video shot over the shoulder of Werther writing letters with a goosefeather quill. An amplified sound system reproducing the sound of the quill scratching words onto parchment can further emphasise the epistolary essence of Goethe’s novel as well as providing a voice-over of Werther reading his letters and their dates. This projected image can be made to flashback and merge into a montage of images of the subjects Werther talks of, such as the natural German countryside which he so loved. This video projection onto the rear cyclorama can be used to illustrate other scenes of the novel which would be difficult to reproduce on the stage, for example, the group of young children playing or the elegant couples dancing at the ball.</p><p>The combination of these above devices can help the stage translation/adaptation achieve a more faithful transposition of the novel but before utilising the devices from the movie <em>Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</em> and the stageplay and movie <em>The Diary of Anne Frank,</em> I had to decide which parts of Goethe’s novel were to be represented on stage and which were to be excluded. Whereas a literary translation cannot make excisions of the original without allegations of augmented authorship, judicious edits must inevitably be made in stage adaptations of most novels for the sake of practicality ; some scenes are impossible, or at least prohibitively costly to reproduce in a theatre. Likewise efforts must be made to not burden the audience with boring long tracts of speech —a good stageplay is more than recitations, it must involve action [[For this reason the scene involving the lengthy discussion between Werther and Albert about the ethics of suicide had to be condensed as was the prolix declamation by Werther of his own extended translation of Ossian.]]. Unfortunately, as has been deliberated apropos the title, when excising parts of the original the adapter automatically jeopardises his work with a possible betrayal of the author’s intent. A perfectly faithful translation/adaptation would spare nothing, but the pragmatics of stagecraft and audience taste must be deferred to if the new creation is to “work”.</p><p>Fortunately, Werther describes many significant events and actions apart from his psychological musings and his letters include quotes of his and other’s dialogue vital to the plot. A good starting point then was to make a compilation of all the actual dialogue in the novel. Thus the passage discussed in Note 3 can be converted to playscript as follows :</p>"},"id":"9724cd74-5a1e-4c43-92ca-fcb07fc1f241","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"“WERTHER\nMay I assist you, pure lady ?\nSERVANT GIRL<em>(Blushing)</em>Oh, no, Sir !\nWERTHER\nCome, come !

For example, at the ball after the storm has passed, Werther and Charlotte are watching the sky through the window and she exclaims “Klopstock !”<em>.</em> Werther kisses her hand and looks into her eyes with admiration. Klopstock was a pre-eminent poet of the “Sturm und Strang” [[“Sturm and Strang” is generally translated as “Storm and stress” ; a period which was characterised by a violent emotional reaction against the intellectualism of the “Aufklärung” (“Enlightenment”) period. Cool reason, self-control and good taste were overthrown in favour of emotion, individuality and freedom. This was the beginning of the age of Romanticism in Germany.]] period but is little known to contemporary English-speaking audiences. The poignancy of this moment between Werther and Charlotte would surely be destroyed if the single word exchanged between them was followed by an explanation of Klopstock’s identity. That one word can summarise their shared appreciation for the poetry and beauty of nature indicates, to Werther at least, that they are similar souls. Fortunately for the proposed stageplay an opportunity was presented earlier when, on the way to the ball, Goethe omits the name of a book Charlotte had been reading but did not enjoy. Werther asks for its title and Goethe has her reply blanked out. Goethe’s footnote explains his desire to remove any cause for complaint from, presumably, the lawyers representing the publishers of the un-named book, as he also justifies his blanks used for certain character’s names. For my purposes these blanks provide a valuable chance to strengthen the narrative. Thus Charlotte replies to the question about the book’s title :</p>"},"id":"36936b88-ce5a-4028-9b41-d4080c45b5da","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"“CHARLOTTE\nWell, it was not the wonderfully epic poetry of Klopstock !”","citation":""},"id":"49317049-1d0f-4abe-84f3-e71a7fb513da","isHidden":false,"type":"quote"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Werther is suitably impressed at her affinity for Klopstock and at this, their first meeting, the seeds for his excessive love are sown.

The dates of the letters must be included thus further foregrounding the epistolary nature of the novel. Taking a cue from the <em>Diary of Anne Frank</em> film and stageplay, the opening line of my conception <em>The Sorrows and Suffering of Young Werther ; a Stageplay ;</em> “How happy I am to be gone”, can be delivered as an echoing spectre’s voice-over in the dark. A video projection can then appear on a rear cyclorama showing vision over the shoulder of Werther writing with a goose-quill as his voice-over narrates from the letters. A flash-back in time can be indicated by a swirling distortion of the vision which gradually takes the shape of a long montage of the German countryside that Werther is describing. The video can then fade to black as the characters on stage begin to speak the dialogue quoted in the novel. At the end of the play, to emphasise Werther’s suffering in suicide and to faithfully portray Goethe’s controversial depiction of Werther as a metaphorical Jesus Christ-like figure (Werther deliberately shoots himself at midnight and dies at noon on Christmas Day), the video can then show a clockface decked with mistletoe —reading twelve— prior to the moment Werther pulls the trigger. At this point in this author’s stageplay the lights can be extinguished as a blood-red explosion of light erupts onto the cyclorama. The video of the clockface can gradually return with the hands shown rotating through to twelve again before fading to black.</p> <p>By using such devices from other relevant adaptations I have attempted to overcome the third major obstacles to faithful adaptation : the novel’s psychological and epistolary nature in my work <em>The Sorrows and Sufferings of Young Werther ; a Stageplay.</em></p>"},"id":"f64041c5-3fa8-4697-b1f5-8c1883a08047","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Conclusion"},"id":"0e3df852-e71b-4eeb-ad2c-5232ea0343e8","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The obstacles to faithful translation/adaptation of <em>Werther</em> to the English language stage are the proscribed theme of noble suicide, the differences in the various English translations, and the epistolary, psychological nature of the novel.

This new work must, according to Goethe’s model, be a prosaic translation, and, according to Wagner’s model it should also be a transpositional adaptation. The productions of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em> and the East German movie <em>Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</em> suggested solutions to the problem of the “untheatricality” of this type of epistolary work. However, the unpopularity of the leitmotif of glorious, noble suicide cannot be sidestepped as previous stage adapters have done. I believe to do so would be a serious augmentation of Goethe’s original intention. Indeed, care must be taken lest a production of <em>The Sorrows and Sufferings of Young Werther ; a Stageplay</em> be so faithful to the original Goethe novel that a wave of Werther Effect suicides by contemporary English-speaking audience members actually results !

<hr />

[1] The researcher/author’s resulting conception <em>The Sorrows and Sufferings of Young Werther ; a Stageplay</em> was submitted as the creative work component of the researcher/author’s thesis at the University of Melbourne in September 2003.

[2] Of course, the very definition of “faithfulness” is problematic, with academic Patrice Pavis calling the notion “a cliché of critical discourse-” (Pavis 26). I understand the term to mean that the main themes and ideas of the original are preserved in the translation/adaptation, or as Steinhauer said : “[It provides] a version for the reader of today in our idiom and yet remain[s] faithful to the spirit of the original” (1774 : vii).

[3] Even the titles differ ; <em>The Sorrows of Werter : a German Story</em> (Malthus 1779) ; <em>Werter and Charlotte ; a German Story</em> (Parsons 1786) ; <em>Sorrows of Werther</em> (Carlyle circa 1850 ; Carlyle and Boylan 1917) ; <em>The Sorrows of Werter/from the German of Goethe</em> (Unknown 1892) ; <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> (Lange 1949 ; Hutter 1962 ; Bogan 1971 ; Hulse 1989 ; Carlyle and Boylan 2001) ; <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em> (Morgan 1957 ; Steinhauer 1970) ; <em>The Sorrows of Young Werter</em> (Ticknor 1966) and the 1991 reprint of Malthus’s translation <em>The Sorrows of Werter/Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.</em>

[4] For example, the very first colloquy in the novel is between Werther and a young servant girl fetching water at the fountain. The German is : “ ‘Soll ich Ihr helfen, Jungfer ?’ sagte ich. —sie ward rot ueber und ueber— ‘O nein, Herr !’ sagte sie —‘Ohne Umstaende’— ” (Goethe 8). This has been variously translated as :

1) “ ‘Shall I help you, my dear ?’ I said. ‘Oh ! No ! Sir !’, she answered, colouring. ‘Make no ceremony,’ said I…” (Malthus 9).<br /> 2) “ ‘Shall I help you, pretty lass’ said I. She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, sir !’ she exclaimed. ‘No ceremony !’ I replied” (Carlyle and Boylan 2001, un-numbered web page).<br /> 3) “ ‘May I assist the young maid ?’ said I. —She blushed from top to toe.— ‘Oh no, sir !’ said she. —‘No standing on ceremony,’ said I” (Hulse 28-29).<br /> 4) “ ‘Shall I help you, Miss ?’ I said —Her face turned a deep red.— ‘Oh no, sir,’ she said. —‘It’s a trifle.’ ” (Steinhauer 4), and,<br /> 5) “ ‘Shall I help you ?’ I said. She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, no, sir.’ She exclaimed. ‘Come now ! No ceremony !’ I replied” (Lange 8).

Apparently, even the least poetic of Goethe’s words can be interpreted differently. Goethe’s word “Jungfer” has been translated as “my dear” by Malthus, “pretty lass” by Carlyle and Boylan, “young maid” by Hulse and “Miss” by Steinhauer, yet the term is avoided entirely by Lange ! Indeed, Lange’s caution is understandable when one reads the <em>Random House</em> definition of ‘jungfer’ ; “Maid, spinster, virgin.” (Dahl 121). Malthus interpreted the word “ Jungfer” as a greeting of affection, Carlyle and Boylan saw its meaning of “prettiness”, Hulse stressed his reading of “youth” and Steinhauser understood it to be “marital status” while neither of them, Lange not withstanding, share my reading of “sexual purity or virginity”, as influenced by the <em>Random House</em> elucidation. It is not unlikely that the Werther values chastity and in the idyllic, unspoiled surroundings of the fountain would recoil from a sight incongruous with that environment. Rather, he rushes to help this “Jungfer”, who blushes like a virgin at his efforts. However, it would also be unlikely that Werther would be so gauche as to cry “Shall I help you, virgin ?” Thus my translated reading of “pure lady” is arrived at by consideration of the previous attempts at translation, the <em>Random House</em> dictionary’s definition, and my own preference, and I translated the above passage as follows :

6) “ ‘May I assist you, pure lady ?’ I said. — She blushed deeply. ‘Oh, no, Sir !’ She exclaimed. ‘Come, come ! Let’s not make a ceremony of it !’ I replied.”

Whilst there are many variations in translation of even this short passage, it must be readily conceded neither Malthus, Carlyle and Boylan, Hulse, Dahl, Lange, Steinhauer nor I have the definitive translation !

[5] Translated by H. Grossman and W. Lyman in 1961.

[6] I translated this as “Why have we Germans no national literature ? The English have one, the French, the Italian…”

[7] I translated this as “The people have to cry over his death but he was far too quickly buried… Why did he kill himself ?”

[8] I translated this as “How happy I am, that I am gone !”

[9] I translated this as “crack-pot”.

[10] Translated into English by B. M. Mooyaart and reprinted in 1995. First published posthumously and edited by Anne Frank’s father, then translated from the Dutch in 1952.

[11] Produced by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.

[12] Produced and directed by George Stevens.

[13] For this reason the scene involving the lengthy discussion between Werther and Albert about the ethics of suicide had to be condensed as was the prolix declamation by Werther of his own extended translation of Ossian.

[14] “Sturm and Strang” is generally translated as “Storm and stress” ; a period which was characterised by a violent emotional reaction against the intellectualism of the “Aufklärung” (“Enlightenment”) period. Cool reason, self-control and good taste were overthrown in favour of emotion, individuality and freedom. This was the beginning of the age of Romanticism in Germany.
